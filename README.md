# Customer Behaviour Analysis
## Discription
This project focused on analyzing customer behavior on an e-commerce website to uncover patterns that influence purchasing decisions, product performance, and marketing effectiveness. The goal was to understand how customers interact with different product categories, identify key drivers of sales, and generate insights that can help improve marketing strategies, user experience, and business growth.
## Business problem or overview
- The e-commerce platform was experiencing fluctuations in sales performance across different regions and product categories. Despite a growing customer base, management lacked clarity on who their key customers were, what influenced their purchasing behavior, and which marketing channels were driving conversions.

- Identify high-value customer segments and retention opportunities.
- Optimize marketing spend across multiple advertising platforms.
- Understand product performance by demographic and income level.
